# Breast Cancer Scikitlearn
Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn. The Algorithm used is KNN classifier.

#Description
In this project dataset used is "Wisconsin Breast Cancer" dataset which is a default, preprocessed and cleaned dataset that comes with scikit-learn. The target is to classify tumor as 'malignant' or 'benign' and code is written in Python using Jupyter notebook. Here I have used k-nearest neighbors algorithm and have achieved an accuracy of 91%.
